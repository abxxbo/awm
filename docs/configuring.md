# Configuring AWM

## Why would you do this?
Stock AWM sucks.

# Window Parameters

## `WINDOW_WIDTH` / `WINDOW_HEIGHT`
The default width/height (in pixels) that awm will use when opening new windows.

## `WINDOW_MIN_W` / `WINDOW_MIN_H`
The smallest width/height (in pixels) that a window can go.

## `BORDER_WIDTH`
Borders around windows. If set to 0, no border will be shown.

## `BORDER_COLOR_UNFOCUSED` / `BORDER_COLOR_FOCUSED`
Self explanatory. Format is `0xRRGGBB`.
